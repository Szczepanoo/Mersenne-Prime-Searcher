# Mersenne-Prime-Searcher

Program implements the Lucas-Lehmer test algorithm to search for Mersenne numbers, which have the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. The algorithm leverages multithreading to concurrently process multiple exponents, speeding up the search for Mersenne numbers. The project uses standard Java libraries and multithreading features from the `java.util.concurrent` package, such as `ExecutorService` and `Future`, to organize parallel processing. For optimization, the program checks Mersenne numbers for exponents in the range from 1 to 82589933, and it outputs information about found Mersenne primes along with the execution time to the console.
